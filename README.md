bach
====

This repository contains a work-in-progress prototype interpreter for an
experimental programming language, Bach.

Bach mainly targets text processing and shell scripting. One of its aims is to
be a kind of Perl with more type safety and a cleaner syntax.

Bach is functional, but not pure. It is concatenative, but not stack-based. It
is statically typed.

Bach is inspired by Perl, Scala, Go, Python, JavaScript, and others.
