# Installation

## Unix-like systems

To install (or upgrade) Bach, install [Go](https://go.dev/) first. Then run:

    go install github.com/texttheater/bach@latest

This will place the `bach` executable in `$GOROOT/bin`, thus in `$HOME/go/bin`
by default. You may want to place it on your `$PATH`.

## Windows

TBD
