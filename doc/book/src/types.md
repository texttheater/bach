# Types

Bach has null, boolean, number, string, array, object, and union types.
Additionally, there is the `Void` type (there are no values of this type) and
the `Any` type (all values are of this type). If you are wondering what the
output type of your program is, you can always compose it with the `type`
function, and you will get a string representation of the output type.

The following table demonstrates this: in the Program column, there are a
number of Bach programs, each consisting of some expression followed by the
`type` function. The Type column indicates the output type of the whole
program. Here, itâ€™s always `Str` because that is the output type of `type`.
Finally, the Value column contains the strings representing the types of the
various expressions.
